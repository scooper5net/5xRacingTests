# 5X Racing Testing
This project uses jest, typescript, javascript, and selenium to test this webpage.
There is a test for chrome browser and a test for firefox which executes the same
tests as each other. 
The tests which are completed here are...
1) Navigate to the page and make sure it lods.
2) Search for 'floor' and get the Drop Floorpan kit in the results.
3) Add the Drop Floorpan kit to the cart and verify the total in the next page.
4) remove the item from the cart and make sure we get a message that the cart is empty.
5) Go to the contact us page and make sure an email is present for the company.
